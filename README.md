An Amazon API Gateway is a collection of resources and methods. For this tutorial, you create one resource (DynamoDBManager) and define one method (POST) on it. The method is backed by a Lambda function (LambdaFunctionOverHttps). That is, when you call the API through an HTTPS endpoint, Amazon API Gateway invokes the Lambda function.

The POST method on the DynamoDBManager resource supports the following DynamoDB operations:

Create, update, and delete an item.
Read an item.
Scan an item.
Other operations (echo, ping), not related to DynamoDB, that you can use for testing.
The request payload you send in the POST request identifies the DynamoDB operation and provides necessary data. For example:

The following is a sample request payload for a DynamoDB create item operation:
```json
{
    "operation": "create",
    "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
    "payload": {
        "Item": {
            "id": "1",
            "name": "Bob"
        }
    }
}
```
The following is a sample request payload for a DynamoDB read item operation:
```json
{
    "operation": "read",
    "tableName": "lambda-apigateway",
    "payload": {
        "Key": {
            "id": "1"
        }
    }
}
```
## Setup
### Create Lambda IAM Role 
Create the execution role that gives your function permission to access AWS resources.

To create an execution role

1. Open the roles page in the IAM console.
2. Choose Create role.
3. Create a role with the following properties.
    * Trusted entity – Lambda.
    * Role name – **lambda-apigateway-role**.
    * Permissions – Custom policy with permission to DynamoDB and CloudWatch Logs. This custom policy has the permissions that  the function needs t write data to DynamoDB and upload logs.
      
    ```json
    {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1428341300017",
      "Action": [
        "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
        "dynamodb:GetItem",
        "dynamodb:PutItem",
        "dynamodb:Query",
        "dynamodb:Scan",
        "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "*"
    },
    {
      "Sid": "",
      "Resource": "*",
      "Action": [
        "logs:CreateLogGroup",
        "logs:CreateLogStream",
        "logs:PutLogEvents"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow"
    }
    ]
    }
    ```
### Create Lambda Function
**To create the function**
1. Click "Create function" in AWS Lambda Console

2. Select "Author from scratch". Use name **LambdaFunctionOverHttps** , select **Python 3.7** as Runtime. Under Permissions, select "Use an existing role", and select **lambda-apigateway-role** that we created, from the drop down

3. Click "Create function"
